This is an example base mod for Gnomoria, used for a Steam modding guide I'm making [ http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642019285 ].
It's also on the Steam Workshop [ http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642713607 ]
You can drop it into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gnomoria\Mods" to start playing

This mod creates a single new workshop that turns wood planks into stone swords.
